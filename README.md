# Site-Tracker

The LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache project implements a data structure that efficiently maintains a set of most frequently searched websites, automatically deleting the least recently used website when the cache reaches its capacity. The implementation combines a doubly linked list and a hashmap for efficient operations.
